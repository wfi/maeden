This file is for expressing the purpose of "Group 4"s work assignment - - 

The purpose of this group is as follows --

Group 4: agent movement conflict resolution (todo 4). 
Several opportunities for conflicts arise that need better resolution than is currently provided. 
For example, two agents may not occupy the same cell (by default). 
If two agents both tried to move into the same cell simultaneously, which one gets to occupy it? 
Or should both fail? Alternatively, if two agents were allowed in the same cell and they both issued
a grab command for the same object at the same time, what should happen? The task for Group 4 is to come up 
with, implement and document a principled approach to conflict resolution in such situations."
