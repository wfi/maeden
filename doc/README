I.  General Overview and Startup

Maeden provides an asynchronous simulation server to separate and
distinct agent controller processes.  The controller may be either a
manual interaction through the keyboard and graphical display (a
sample controller is provided in KeyboardController.java) or an
autonomous process.  The simulation presents a grid-world consisting
of a small number of itmes which may be manipulated in order to
accomplish various tasks.  Users of Maeden may create their own worlds
and tasks within them.  The default task is to locate and consume a
food item.  The simulater comes with several sets of ready-made worlds
provide a wide range of task difficulties.  In the default condition,
the simulation ends once the food is eaten.  Thus, the simulator must
(currently) be started separately for each world.

A run consists of the server process and one additional process for
each agent.  The server should be started first, with command line
arguments specifying the world to simulate.  For example:

    $ java Grid worlds/tw03

will initiate a simulation using the test-world numebr 3 with the
graphical display enabled.  Optional arguments following the world
include:
- a boolean flag enabling/disabling the global graphical
  display (useful for debugging agent behaviors), 
- the number of agents that will be connecting to this simulation,
- the number of milliseconds to wait between simulation time steps
  (default 50 milliseconds).

Once the server has been started as described, it begins listening for
agent connection requests.  Agents can connect and disconnect at their
own discretion without interrupting the simulation (see Sockets
README).  Note however, if the default task condition is true, then
consuming the food (once obtained) will terminate the simulation for
all agents currently active in it.  Once an agent connects, it may
sense, think and act at its own rate up to the resolution of the
simulator.  Multiple agents sense and act asynchronously.  The
sense-think-act cycle is governed by the protocol described in the
Sensory-Motor Interface README.

Further instructions for starting the server and the required
arguments are found in the source code for the server, Grid.java.  The
controller(s) for any agents are started as separate processes in
accordance with the languages used to implement them.  For a simple
simulation involving a single agent controlled by a human, one would
start the server one shell as described above and then start the
Keyboard Controller

    $ java KeyboardController

in a second shell.  The KeyboardController provides an overhead view
of what the agent sees, other sensory information in a dashboard, and
an interface for submitting commands to the server.

--------------------------------------------------------
II.  Java Code Architecture

A Grid class defines the overall simulation object.  Items that appear
in a simulated world inherit from the GridObject class and by
convention have names such as GOBWall, GOBHammer, and GOBAgent.
Objects and agents in the simulated world are represented as instances
of classes that are managed by the Grid object.  An external agent
controller is associated with a thin object (GOBAgent) in the
simulation that serves as the interface to the Grid simulation,
providing sensory information and passing along action requests.  For
more information, see Class Relationships README.

--------------------------------------------------------
III.  Communication over Sockets

All communication between an agent controller and the simulator proper
is done through standard network sockets.  Consequently, agent
controllers may be implemented in any language that supports this
standard interface.  For example, a controller written in Common Lisp
can control an agent in the Maeden simulator (written in Java) and can
interact with another agent controlled by a program written in C++,
and both can interact with another agent being controlled by a human
via the KeyboardController program.  To learn more about Socket
communication, see the file Sockets README; for details of the
sensory-motor protocol, see Sensory-Motor Interface README.

--------------------------------------------------------
IV.  Inter-Agent Communication

Agents in the Maeden simulator have the capability to talk to one
another.  In order to formulate a coherent message to be transmitted
to other agents, it must be sent in the correct form.  To learn more
see the Inter-Agent Communication README.

--------------------------------------------------------
V.  Agent Sensory-Motor Interface

All agents in the Maeden simulator have a set of "senses" and
"effectors" through which agents interact with the environment.
Senses provide limited information to the controller on the basis of
which actions are selected.  The sensory data and action specification
protocols consists of one or more lines of text as described in
Sensory-Motor Interface README.
